This is Karma-makes-stuff-2: electric boogaloo

I make little code prjects to learn how to code.
Don't expect me to maintain any project for more than a month, unless there is an active community submitting pull requests.

My code prolly won't brick your pc, but I'd suggest that you read through it before you run it as administrator

got my old account back, will leave this one inactive
