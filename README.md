This is Karma-makes-stuff-2: electric boogaloo

I make little code prjects to learn how to code.
Don't expect me to maintain any project for more than a month, unless there is an active community submitting pull requests.

My code prolly won't brick your pc, but I'd suggest that you read through it before you run it as administrator

  <summary>Unnessesary rant</summary>

The reason why this account exists is because the dickheads at Github locked me out of my original account.
That doesn't mean that I'm banned or anything, my 2fa just refuses to work.
Not only that, but my recovery codes have also been as useful as a hedgehog in a condom factory.

I'm normally pretty chill, but getting locked out of my account because of a security measure that I was forced into,
through no fault of my own, really grinds my gears.
